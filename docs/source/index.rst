Welcome to DynAPI's documentation!
===================================

**DynAPU** (/dyn'api/) is a Python project for all postgres databases
that creates a dynamic api regardless of database/table structures.
It pulls data from the informative tables built into Postgres, and converts these to dynamic API endpoints, with all CRUD operations and filtering enabled.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`setup` the project.
